In this semester, you will help Nezzar with various problems. Good luck and have fun!

In this very beginning task, You are required to implement a simple text editor to get familiar with online judge system.

This simple text editor should consist of ~100~ empty strings after initialization, with index ~0, 1, \ldots, 99~. In each round, Nezzar may do following operation, and your simple text editor should support these features.

- *st side 1 c*, insert character *c* to string with index *st*. 

- *st side 2*, remove one character from string with index *st* and output it in one line if string *st* is non-empty. Otherwise, output character *#*

- *st side 3* output one character from string with index *st*.

The *side* parameter indicates the position we will operate on. If ~side = 0~, we will perform operation on the leftmost side, and rightmost otherwise.

# Input

The first line of input contains one integer ~Q(1 \le Q \le 10^6)~, the number of operations.

Each line of the following ~Q~ lines contains an operation descrided in the legend. It is guaranteed that all character will be lowercase/uppercase Latin letter.

# Output

For each type 2/3 operation, output one line with required character.

# Subtasks

- (100 points) No further constraints.

# Note

Subtask may give you some partial score if you cannot fully solve this problem. 

However, you will receive corresponding scores only if you pass all tests we prepare under corresponding constraints. Specifically, you will receive a zero score if you fail to pass some tests in this task.
