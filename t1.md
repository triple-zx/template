Nezzar is addicted to game Gold Miner recently.

Gold Miner is a game in which player is in an ~n \times n~ grid, and his goal is to collect gold without entering forbidden area. It is known that cell ~(i,j)~ is forbidden to enter if and only if ~i = j~ or ~i = j + 1~.

In one round, Nezzar may choose two non-empty sets ~X,Y \subset [n]~, and collect gold in cell ~(i,j)~ for all ~i \in X, j \in Y~. However, he immediately fails if there exists ~i \in X~ and ~j \in Y~ such that ~(i,j)~ is forbidden to enter. 

As a greedy miner, Nezzar would like to enter all but forbidden cells to collect gold. However, he is run out of time! He can only perform no more than ~50~ rounds. Can you design an algorithm to solve this problem for him?

# Input

The only line contains one integer ~n~ (~2 \le n \le 5000~), the size of grid.

# Output

**Please read this part carefully, as you may fail to pass sample test if you ignore some format issue.**

For each round with subsets ~X,Y~ being chosen, output elements in ~X~ **increasingly** in the first line, and then output elements in ~Y~ **increasingly** in the second line.

# Sample Input
        3

# Sample Output
        1
        2 3
        1 2
        3
        3
        1

# Note
It is **allowed** to enter some cell multiple times!
        
# Subtasks
- (5 points) ~n \le 7~
- (15 points) ~n \le 50~
- (10 points) ~n \le 100~
- (30 points) ~n \le 1000~
- (40 points) ~n \le 5000~

# Hint

Believe it or not, we can use divide-and-conquer technique to solve this task.

~T(n)~ denote the number of rounds we need to solve above task with parameter ~n~. Notice that ~T(n)=T(n/2)+O(1)~ implies ~T(n)=O(\log n)~, we may derive our algorithm from it!
