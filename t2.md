After learning BST in algorithm class, Nezzar challenges you with the following task.

Given a **multiset** ~S~ which is intially emtpy, Nezzar may do one of the following operations in each round, and your code should support these features.

- 0 ~x~, insert ~x~ to ~S~;
- 1 ~x~, output the number of copies of ~X~ in ~S~, and remove exactly **one copy** of ~x~ from ~S~ if ~S~ contains at least one copy of ~x~;
- 2 ~l, r~, output ~\sum_{x \in S, l < x \le r} x~. 

To disallow some shortcut solutions(offline solutions), Nezzar provides input in the following ways (~lans~ is 0 initially).

- 0 ~y~, let ~x = (y + lans) \mod mod~ and insert ~x~ to ~S~;
- 1 ~y~, let ~x = (y + lans) \mod mod~ and output number of copies of ~x~ in ~S~, and remove exactly **one copy** of ~x~ from ~S~ if ~S~ contains at least one copy of ~x~;
- 2 ~u, v~, let ~l = (u + lans) \mod mod, y = (v + lans) \mod mod~, swap ~l~ and ~r~ if ~l>r~, output ~\sum_{x \in S, l < x \le r} x~ and finally update ~lans~ with output. 

# Input

The first line of input contains two integers ~Q,mod~(~1 \le Q \le 5 \cdot 10^5~, ~1 \le mod \le 10^9~).

Each of the following ~Q~ lines contains an operation described in the statement.

# Output

For each type 1 and type 2 query, output one line with required value.

# Sample Input
    7 15
    1 2
    0 3
    0 6
    2 0 7
    0 5
    2 4 5
    2 5 4
    

# Sample Output
    0
    9
    14
    0

# Note
Initially, ~S=\{\}~.
Parameter for the first query is ~x = (y + lans) \mod mod = 2~. Hence, ~S=\{\}~ after first query.

Parameter for the second query is ~x = (y + lans) \mod mod = 3~. Hence, ~S=\{2\}~ after the second query.

        
# Subtasks
- (5 points) ~Q \le 1000~
- (10 points) It is gauranteed that there exists no type 2 query.
- (10 points) It is gauranteed that the total number of type 2 query is no more than ~100~.
- (35 points) It is gauranteed that testcases are generated randomly.
- (40 points) No further constraints.
