There's a segment ~I=[0,n]~ initially painted with color white. Nezzar chooses a permutation ~p~ of length ~n~, and repaint the segment in the following process.

- In the ~i~-th day, he repaints segment ~[p_i-1,p_i]~ with color ~p_i~.

Define balance of segment ~I~ the largest length of continuous subsegment ~I'~ painted **in the same color**. Nezzar challenges you to calculate the balance of segment ~I~ right after ~i~-th day for ~1 \le i \le n~. 

# Input

The first line of input contains single integer ~n~ (~1 \le n \le 10^6~).

The following line contains ~N~ integers ~p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n~ (~1 \le p_i \le n~).

It is gauranteed that ~p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n~ forms a permutation of length ~n~.

# Output

Output ~n~ desired values in one line.
